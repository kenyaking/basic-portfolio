            Greetings! My name is Kenya and I'm a native of Sandersville, Georgia. It's a small town not too far from Augusta, Georgia. I grew up being very creative and was always
            involved with the arts and music. Professionally, I've continued to use my creativity, support the arts and work in media-related fields. For more than ten years, I have working in
            marketing and public relations in higher education and recently transitioned to government. Some of my professional work experience has included supporting websites through 
            content management systems. As a result, I'm taking this course to enhance my overall web development skills.

            A few fun facts about me are that I was a lperformer in a corporate band and was also a part of the Atlanta Workshop Players theater group for several years.  
            Currently, I work as an application development and communications manager for one of the most populus county in metro-Atlanta and I lead a small centralized web team. 
            My role is primarily focused on providing strategic direction pertaining to the website, branding, analytics, and marketing. 
        <br>
            A final fun fact is that while working in academia, I was also a freelance journalist and interviewed numerous dignatairies and celebrities including the late Maya Angelou. 
            I was one of the last people to interview her before she passed away.
